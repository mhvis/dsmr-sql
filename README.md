# DSMR-SQL

Logs DSMR telegrams in a PostgreSQL database for visualization with Grafana.

## Comparison with DSMR-reader

I used [DSMR-reader](https://github.com/dsmrreader/dsmr-reader)
in the past to log the consumption data.
It is awesome and I can recommend it to anybody.
I wrote this new app because I wanted a more flexible and leaner alternative, DSMR-reader
has a lot of features that I don't use.
